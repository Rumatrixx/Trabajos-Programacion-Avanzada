I started my project making all the classes that my project needed, I made the class Vehicle, Engine and the types of vehicle inherited from vehicle as Car, Truck,
motorcycle and Yatch, defining their components and if it was necesarry, inheriting them to the derived classes. Also i created a dictionary and a list to save the engines
and the vehicles. After I was sure my classes had all the properties for the code I created a method to calculate the gas consumption of each car, following the formula 
that the exercise gave. Then I decided to create two more methods that will allow me to do the process of creating an engine and creating a vehicle. Finally I coded the 
menu option for the project giving different options in order to achieve the requierements of the project.
